### GitHub
My website is hosted on [*GitHub*](https://github.com/) and uses
[`GitHub Pages`](https://pages.github.com/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to build and manage the website remotely
from my local computer. This means that I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to maintain the source text for my blogs.

### Local Computer
I run [Windows 10 Home Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/windows) as the operating system on my local computer and use
[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my text editor for generating website content locally and for general maintenance of my computer system.
