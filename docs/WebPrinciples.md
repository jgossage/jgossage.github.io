This section looks at websites from a technical point of view. It is unlikely to be interesting to users, such as bloggers, who do not place strong technical demands on the website, but organizations may need to pay careful attention to the topics discussed here. The use of a website always involves at least two components:
#### Centralized Site
The purpose of a website is to host content that may be accessed by many potential viewers. This has a number of implications.
* The site must be easily accessible to potential viewers.\
This usually means that the website is hosted in an accessible location on the Internet.
* The local content viewer should not need anything special to access content on the central website.\
This is why web content is accessed through a program on the user's local computer that is called a **browser**. A **browser** is almost always installed as part of the content of a operating system that allows a user to employ a computer for many purposes.
