# Build a Website
This blog will try to suggest a way of developing a website for personal use. It is probably of most interest to people who have some background in computing since the development and maintenance process  makes heavy use a number of computer based tools during the development and maintenance of the site.

This is not a recipe, rather it is a guide. It could only be considered a recipe by those who have a computing environment that is close to identical to that which I have. Anyone else will need to adapt some or many of the details described in this blog to their environment.

The blog has three parts and I suggest that you skip any part that you do not find relevant:
# [General Principles](./WebPrinciples)
* The general nature of websites
* The objectives for a website
* Some of the operational and maintenance concepts that apply to any website.
# [My Website](./WebsiteNature)
# [Building My Website](./WebsiteConstruction)
