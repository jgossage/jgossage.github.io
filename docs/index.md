# Build a Website
This blog will try to suggest a way of developing a website for personal use. It
is probably of most interest to people who have some background in computing
since it makes heavy use a number of computer based tools during the development
and maintenance of the site.

This is not a recipe, rather it is a guide. It could only be considered a recipe
by those who have a computing environment that is close to identical to that
wich I have. Anyone else will need to adapt some of the details described in
this blog to their environment.

The blog has three parts:
# [General Principles](./GeneralPrinciples)
# [My Website](./WebsiteNature)
# [Building My Website](./WebsiteConstruction)
