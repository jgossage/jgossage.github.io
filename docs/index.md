# Build a Website
This blog post will try to suggest a way of developing and maintaining a website for personal use. It is probably of most interest to people who have some background in computing since the development and maintenance process makes heavy use of a number of computer based tools during the development and maintenance of the site.

This is not a recipe, rather it is a guide. It could only be considered a recipe by those who have a computing environment that is close to identical to that which I have. Anyone else will need to adapt some or many of the details described in this blog post to their environment.

The post has five parts and I suggest that you skip any part that is not relevant to you.
